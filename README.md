# Date Calculator

A simple console application written in C that includes the following options:

1. Checking if a date is valid.
2. Calculating a next day.
3. Calculating the earliest date from a given array of dates.
4. Caluclating the day of the week (on the basis of the date).

The last functionality is possible by using the Gauss' algorithm.
